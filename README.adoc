Chrono is a git versioning tool with a focus on being customizable and easy to configure.

It is inspired by the likes of https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion[GitVersion] and https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning[Nerdbank.Gitversioning].

=== Road to 1.0 

* Build intermediate 0.9 version -> no public release though
* Ensure config examples are up to date
* Adjust documentation
* Debug builds for dotnet tasks should work
* Create self-contained builds for various platforms
* Enhance logging and error handling/reporting

=== Commands

=== 🚀 Getting started 

Install/Update the dotnet tool using

|Install|Update

[source]

Next up create a version.yml (for now only a version.yml at the root of your git repo is supported)

For the content of version.yml either checkout the minimal example below.

[source,yml]
----
version: "1.0.0"
default:
  versionSchema: "{major}.{minor}.{patch}[-]{branch}[-]{commitShortHash}"
  precision: "minor"  
  release:
    match:
      - "^release/.*"
    versionSchema: "{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

==== 🕹️ ️Automatic Version stamping (dotnet) 

If you want your dotnet projects to be automatically versioned first make sure your projects are using SDK style project files and don't have existing AssemblyVersion.cs files or the likes present.

Then call

[source,shell]
----
chrono init
----

in your project root.

This adds a Directory.Build.props file to the directory which takes care of including the DotnetTasks package into your projects.

It also sets the two properties "IncludeSourceRevisionInInformationalVersion" to false and "GenerateAssemblyInfo" to true.

In theory that's it :)
